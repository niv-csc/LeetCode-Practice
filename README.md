# LeetCode Daily Practice Solutions

This repository contains my daily solutions to LeetCode problems.  
Each file is named according to the problem number and title for easy reference.

## 📌 Goals
- Practice problem-solving consistently
- Improve coding skills in multiple languages
- Build a collection of solutions for future review

## 🛠 Languages Used
- Java
- Python
- C++
- (and more as I explore)

## 📂 Structure
- Each solution is stored in a separate file.
- Filenames follow the format:  
  `_ProblemNumber_Problem_Title.java` (or `.py`, `.cpp` depending on language)

## 🚀 Progress
I update this repository daily with new solutions.
